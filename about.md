Hello! I'm Ben.  I'm currently a Senior at the International School
Bangkok.  I enjoy all sorts of things, but especially computer
science, music and reading.  I'll mainly blog about programming
related things, or anything that crosses my mind.

This site was created with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
